Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), previously Borivali National Park,[2], is a large protected area on the northern fringes of suburban Mumbai city in Maharashtra State in India.[3] It encompasses an area of 104 km2 (40 sq mi) and is surrounded on three sides by India's most populous city.[4] It is notable as one of the few national parks existing within a metropolis limit in Asia and is one of the most visited parks in the world[3] It also enjoys the distinction of being the largest urban park in the world.<br>

The rich flora and fauna of Sanjay Gandhi National Park attracts more than 2 million visitors every year. Tourists also enjoy visiting the 2400 years old Kanheri caves sculpted out of the rocky cliffs which lie within the park.<br>

The undulating green lands of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park have a natural environment which tourists love to retreat to for moments of quiet introspection or meditation. The great views of forests, hills, valleys, lakes and open expanses have a therapeutic effect on mind, body and soul.[5]<br>

The Sanjay Gandhi National Park area has a long written history dating back to the 4th century BCE. In ancient India, Sopara and Kalyan were two ports in the vicinity that traded with ancient civilizations such as Greece and Mesopotamia. The 45 km (28 mi) land route between these two ports was partially through this forest.[6]<br>

The Kanheri Caves in the centre of the park were an important Buddhist learning centre and pilgrimage site sculpted by Buddhist monks between the 1st century BCE and the 9th century BCE.[7] They were chiseled out of a massive basaltic rock outcropping.[8]<br>

The park was named 'Krishnagiri National Park' in the pre-independence era. At that time the area of the park was only 20.26 km2 (7.82 sq mi). In 1969, the park was expanded to its present size by acquiring various reserve forest properties adjoining the park. After this, an independent unit of the Forest Department called 'Borivali National Park Sub-division' administered the area. Krishnagiri National Park was created in 1974 and later renamed as 'Borivali National Park'. In 1981, it was re-dedicated as 'Sanjay Gandhi National Park' in memory of Sanjay Gandhi, the son of ex Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi, who was killed in an air crash in 1980.<br>
