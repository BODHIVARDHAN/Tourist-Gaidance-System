Panshet Dam was constructed 
                  about 40 years back for irrigation purpose in Pune. The dam 
                  lies about 50 km southwest of the city of Pune in Maharashtra. 
                  The Panshet Dam is located close to two other dams nearby; one 
                  of them is the Khadakwasla. The Panshet Dam supplies drinking 
                  water to the city of Pune. <BR><BR>The dam wall burst in the 
                  first year of storing water on 2 July 1961. The huge floods in 
                  the valley was however, managed by the Khadakwasla dam in the 
                  downstream. The tremendous damage in Pune City was a 
                  well-known event on the banks of the Mutha River. The 
                  Government reconstructed the dam in the later years. Panshet 
                  is one of the popular places near Pune as a picnic spot. In 
                  the recent years, Panshet is popular because of its thrilling 
                  water sports, including Speed Boats and Water Scooters. The 
                  travelers are assured to have a great trip to Panshet, 
                  surrounded by dark green woods. <BR><BR>This article is a
