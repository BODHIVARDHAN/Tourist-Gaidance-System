Koyna Dam :-<br>
Main artical:-Koyna Dam <br>
The Koyna Dam is one of the largest dams in Maharashtra, India. It is located in Koyna Nagar, nestled in the Western Ghats on the state highway between Chiplun and Karad, Maharashtra.<br>

The dam supplies water to western Maharashtra as well as cheap hydroelectric power to the neighbouring areas with a capacity of 1,920 MW. The Koyna project is actually composed of four dams, with the Koyna Dam having the largest catchment area.<br>

The catchment area dams the Koyna River and forms the Shivaji Lake which is approximately 50 km (31 mi) in length. Completed in 1963, it is one of the largest civil engineering projects commissioned after Indian independence. The Koyna electricity project is run by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. Most of the generators are located in excavated caves a kilometre deep, inside the heart of the surrounding hills.<br>

The dam has contributed to earthquakes in the recent past[citation needed], including the devastating 1967 Koynanagar earthquake that almost razed the dam, resulting in the dam developing major cracks.<br>
